These source files are written in [human-friendly Markdown](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/). They are meant to be parsed with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to generate the final HTML pages published at [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/).

Although arguably less convenient to work with than a Wiki, this enables us to easily merge pull requests and constantly improve our documentation in a transparent way.
Direct access to the source files in a revision control system is a big plus to ensure the quality of our documentation.

## Editing Content ##

At the top of each generated page is an *edit this page* link to the corresponding page on GitHub, where you can make changes (and submit pull requests with a few clicks) without needing to know Git or run anything on your system.

To make more extensive changes, fork this repository, modify the corresponding `.md` source files (or create new ones), commit the changes, push them back to your fork, and then submit a pull request to our `develop` branch.

### Project Layout ###

```text
mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
docs/
    index.md  # The documentation homepage.
    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
```

### Build Setup ###

#### Create .env File ####

If you have a personal access token for the MkDocs Material Insider edition,
add you GitHub access token to an .env file in the main project directory:

```env
GH_TOKEN=[YOUR TOKEN]
```

New GitHub access tokens can be generated on https://github.com/settings/tokens.

#### Installing MkDocs ####

When using a Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint Linux, run this command the first time you work with this repository on your computer so that the dependencies are installed:

```
make deps
```

Otherwise, install Python 3 and Pip manually and run the following command:

```
make install
```

#### Fixing Permissions ####

In case files in the project directory have bad permissions and mkdocs cannot read or write them:

```
make fix
```

### Using MkDocs ###

First make sure you have Docker and common development tools like `make` installed on your computer.

Then use this command in the main project directory to download and run the latest version of
[mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material):

```sh
make watch
```

Now open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in a browser to view the rendered documentation.

**The content will be updated automatically when changes are detected.**

### Deployment ###

When you merge the `develop` branch to `deploy`, the live documentation is automatically created, uploaded and will be visible shortly.

Linux/Unix users can run `make merge` in a terminal. Otherwise, please use the tools provided by your development environment or editor.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ###

After you submit your first pull request, you will be asked to accept our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Visit [photoprism.app/cla](https://www.photoprism.app/cla) to learn more.
