# Thumbnail Image API

## Introduction

Like most commercial image hosting services, we have chosen to implement a **cookie-free** thumbnail API to minimize request latency by avoiding unnecessary network traffic:

- When a browser requests static files such as images from a server over HTTPS, it is generally unnecessary to send a cookie with each request if the URLs cannot be guessed, so for most practical use cases
- One possible use of cookies may be to prevent the user from intentionally or accidentally sharing confidential thumbnail URLs with others
- This is possible with most image hosting services/social media sites, and could also be considered a feature if you just want to share a few thumbnails without a lot of bells and whistles
- Once an image has been downloaded by someone else, blocking the original URL provides little additional security, as digital copies are just as good as the original, see info box below
- Keeping that in mind, previously shared URLs can be invalidated by [changing the security token in your config](../../getting-started/config-options.md#security-tokens)
- This will invalidate the browser cache on all connected devices, requiring previously cached thumbnails to be downloaded again
- Be aware that frequent token changes result in performance degradation and a poor user experience.

In addition to better performance, a major advantage of cookie-free thumbnails is that they can be easily integrated into a content delivery network (CDN), since there is no need to check cookies or add other complex logic on edge servers.

    Since most users only have one domain/host name and modern web applications can store [authentication tokens](auth.md) in *localStorage*, our Thumbnail Image API does not currently require or use cookies.

### Security Considerations

Digital copies are as good as originals: Once shared and downloaded, such images should be considered "leaked" because they are cached and can be re-shared by the recipient at any time, with no sure way to get all copies back, even if the download URL becomes invalid or the service is shut down completely.

Any form of protection we could provide would essentially be "snake oil", could be circumvented, and would have a negative impact on the user experience, such as disabling the browser cache or context menu.

For the highest level of protection, it is recommended to shield your private server from the public Internet. Always use **HTTPS, a VPN and/or ideally TLS client certificates** and make sure that only people you trust have access to your instance.

## Image Endpoint URI

A GET request to the following URI returns a thumbnail image of the [specified size](#thumbnail-sizes) for the picture referenced by the SHA1 hash:

```
/api/v1/t/:hash/:token/:size
```

If the instance requires authentication, you must also specify a valid [security token](search.md#response-headers), e.g.:

```
/api/v1/t/a2195b6840f46b555719d8e22e9b080e61a7317c/10d68214/tile_500
```

With public mode enabled, you can instead use "public" as [security token](search.md#response-headers) placeholder:

```
/api/v1/t/a2195b6840f46b555719d8e22e9b080e61a7317c/public/tile_500
```

## Video Endpoint URI

A GET request to the following URI returns the video referenced by the SHA1 hash (transcoding and range requests are supported for streaming):

```
/api/v1/videos/:hash/:token/:format
```

If the instance requires authentication, you must also specify a valid [security token](search.md#response-headers), e.g.:

```
/api/v1/videos/51843134d75f4cbde534270cdd5954067f887ee6/10d68214/avc
```

With public mode enabled, you can instead use "public" as [security token](search.md#response-headers) placeholder:

```
/api/v1/videos/51843134d75f4cbde534270cdd5954067f887ee6/public/avc
```

    The only target format currently available for transcoding is `avc` (MPEG-4 AVC). Additional formats will become available in a future release.

## Thumbnail Sizes

The smallest configurable static and dynamic size limit is 720px, so most sizes up to `fit_720` are **always** generated by default.
[Higher size limits](../../user-guide/settings/advanced.md#preview-images) generate thumbnails with more detail at higher resolutions - either statically (pre-generated while indexing) or **on demand** if the [configuration permits](../../getting-started/config-options.md#preview-images).

**Optional** thumbnail sizes cannot be pre-generated and are only rendered on request, for example when sharing an image on Instagram.

The following overview shows the name, dimensions, and aspect ratio for each thumbnail size as well as a description of how it is used:

    Generated thumbnail files are stored in the `storage/cache/thumbnails` folder, where the path and file name depend on the [thumbnail size](../media/thumbnails.md#standard-sizes) and original file hash. [Learn more ›](../media/thumbnails.md)
