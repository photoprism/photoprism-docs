**We strive to build an application that embraces simplicity and avoids unexpected behavior. It must be able to run on a wide range of devices. Its user interface must be easy to use for everyone.**

## Icons ##

Since Vuetify is based on Material Design, we stick with the following icons and only use other icons when absolutely necessary (e.g. for sharing):

## Colors ##

Our UI themes should all contain a color spectrum so that they look like a prism:

- https://www.schemecolor.com/?s=google
- https://www.schemecolor.com/memories-of-the-garden.php
- https://www.schemecolor.com/double-disclosure.php
- https://www.schemecolor.com/true-lovers-color-scheme.php
- https://www.schemecolor.com/sunset-painting.php
- https://www.schemecolor.com/happy-with-self.php
