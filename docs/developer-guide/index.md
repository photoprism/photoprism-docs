## Join the Community ##

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photoprism_app) and join the [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
to get regular updates, connect with other contributors, and discuss your ideas. Our [Code of Conduct](https://photoprism.app/code-of-conduct) explains the "dos and don’ts."

An important part of our journey is to explore new ways in product development and build better software through consistent use of community feedback. Feel free to [share your thoughts](../contact.md) with us at any time.

## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](../getting-started/troubleshooting/index.md)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, it could be a local configuration
issue, or a misunderstanding in how the software works:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions)

When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and [other information about your environment](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
such as [browser, browser plugins](../getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers.md), operating system, storage type,
memory size, and processor.

**We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue that must be fixed directly in the app.**

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Because we want to create the best possible product for our users, we have a [set of criteria](pull-requests.md#acceptance-criteria)
to ensure that all submissions are acceptable.

Follow our [step-by-step guide](pull-requests.md#how-to-create-and-submit-a-pull-request) to learn how to submit
new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions.

**Reviewing, testing, and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources on our side. If it's not just a small fix, it can take several months.**
