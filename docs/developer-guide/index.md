## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##

The [public roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.

You are welcome to [submit specific feature requests](issues.md) if you have verified that no similar
[idea](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/idea) or [todo](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/todo)
already exists. Give ideas you like a thumbs-up 👍  , so that we know what is most popular.

    Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.

## Join the Community ##

Follow us on [Twitter](https://link.photoprism.app/twitter) and join the [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat)
to get regular updates, connect with other contributors, and discuss your ideas. Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct) explains the "dos and don’ts."

An important part of our journey is to explore new directions in product development and build better software through consistent use of feedback.

Feel free to [contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) with anything that is on your mind, even if you just want to say hello. It is our goal to answer all questions we receive from our users, customers, partners, and the developer community. Our team also welcomes feedback if you believe something can or should be improved.

## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](../getting-started/troubleshooting/index.md)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, it could be a local configuration
issue, or a misunderstanding in how the software works:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions)

When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and [other information about your environment](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs)
such as [browser, browser plugins](../getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers.md), operating system, storage type,
memory size, and processor.

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app.

Note that all issue **subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for discussions, questions or expressing personal opinions.

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Follow our [step-by-step guide](pull-requests.md) to learn how to submit new features, bug fixes, and documentation enhancements.

Pull requests solving ["help wanted"](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) issues are the easiest to merge and the most helpful to us, as they allow us to spend more time on core functionality and other issues that are difficult for external contributors to work on. If you are new to this project, anything labeled ["easy"](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) may be a good first contribution.

**Be aware that reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources on our side. It can therefore take several months if it is not just a small fix, especially if extensive testing is needed to prevent bugs from getting into our stable version.**

## Infrastructure Sponsors ##

A big thank you goes to [our sponsors](../credits.md), whose generous support has been and continues to be essential to the success of the project:

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) hosts our [code repositories](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism) and also provides many other important services
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) approved us for their [Open Source Program](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application/) and hosts all of our app images
- [**Element**](https://element.io/) develops and [operates the infrastructure](https://matrix.org/) that our [community chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat) is based on
- [**BrowserStack**](https://www.browserstack.com/) provides [free access](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source) to their device and browser testing infrastructure

!!! example "Privacy Notice"
    We operate a number of web services that help us develop and maintain our software in collaboration with the open source community, for example [translate.photoprism.app](https://translate.photoprism.app/).
    
    Because many of these apps and tools were originally developed for internal use without a high level of privacy in mind, we ask that you do not enter personal information such as your real name or personal email address if you want it to remain private.
    
    **Personal details may otherwise show up in logs, source code, translation files, commit messages, and pull request comments.**
