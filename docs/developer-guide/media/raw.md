Professional and semi-professional photographers often keep their originals in a [lossless RAW format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format), close to how they were taken with the physical sensor, rather than in a compressed image format like JPEG, especially if they shoot with a digital SLR camera. Newer mobile phones may also be able to capture images in RAW mode. Our goal is to provide top-notch support for [all RAW images](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#what-media-file-types-are-supported), regardless of camera make and model. A full list of file types and extensions can be found in our [Knowledge Base](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/file-formats).

## RAW Conversion

Since web browsers generally cannot display RAW image files directly, they must be converted. This is done during [import](../../user-guide/library/import.md) or [initial indexing](../../user-guide/library/index.md). It can also be triggered manually [in a terminal](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) with the `photoprism convert` command.

## Adobe XMP

PhotoPrism currently supports Darktable and RawTherapee as RAW image converters (as well as Sips on macOS). Darktable fully supports XMP sidecar files, RawTherapee might only partially. However, XMP is only a "container" format, so the fields (namespaces) used there to indicate how an image should be converted (as well as other metadata) differ between Lightroom/Photoshop, Darktable, and RawTherapee.
    
In other words, just because an application generally supports XMP that doesn't mean it can use metadata created with another application or by another vendor like Adobe. If you think that's confusing, well, that's because it is. You have an open format, but you still suffer from vendor lock-in - probably not entirely unintentional on Adobe's part.

From our experience, some basic edits done with Adobe tools - such as cropping - might be preserved when you convert the same RAW image with other software like Darktable. Advanced edits, such as lens or color corrections, will likely not be applied.

## Darktable

If installed, Darktable CLI can be used for RAW image conversion. Note that PhotoPrism will only run one instance of `darktable-cli` at the same time if the `PHOTOPRISM_RAW_PRESETS` config option is enabled, so existing Darktable presets can be applied (requires an exclusive lock).

### Using Darktable as library

We had the idea to use [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) and link directly against `libdarktable.so` to convert RAW images to JPEG, see [darktable-dev mailing list](https://www.mail-archive.com/darktable-dev@lists.darktable.org/msg03608.html). However this requires calling/wrapping a large number of C functions and also has other [disadvantages](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go). The idea is postponed until a clear benefit becomes visible. Running `darktable-cli` or any other binary that does the job (see above) seems to be the way to go.

## RawTherapee

If installed, RawTherapee CLI can also be used for RAW image conversion. If it used by default if Darktable isn't installed or disabled.

### JPEG Size Limit

RawTherapee cannot limit the resolution of JPEG files when converting files from other formats such as RAW, DNG, HEIC or AVIF. In general, when converting images, the resolution of the generated JPEG files can be limited with the environment variable `PHOTOPRISM_JPEG_SIZE` or the CLI parameter `--jpeg-size`.

## Scriptable Image Processing System (Sips)

On a Mac, PhotoPrism can convert multiple files at once using Sips (pre-installed on OS X). It is not available for other operating systems.

## Comparison of RAW to JPEG converters

- [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) - popular open-source photography app and raw developer; available for Mac, Linux, and Windows; supports XMP (compatible with photoshop/lightroom?)
- Mac OS X ships with [sips](https://coderwall.com/p/nhp7mq/convert-raw-photos-to-jpg-in-the-mac-os-terminal): `sips -s format jpeg IMAGE.RAW --out IMAGE.JPG`
- [Photivo](http://photivo.org/) - open-source photo processor; available for Mac, Linux, and Windows; no XMP support?
- [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com/) - open-source RAW image processing app; available for Mac, Linux, and Windows; no XMP support?
- [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/about/) - open-source digital photo management application based on Qt (KDE); available for Mac, Linux, and Windows; supports XMP (compatible with photoshop/lightroom?)
- [UFRaw](http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/) - Unidentified Flying Raw is a utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras

`*` Compared to JPG/EXIF converted from photoshop

### Image Diff

The following table shows the difference between the JPEG files converted by Darktable, Sips, Rawtherapee, UFraw and ImageMagick compared to Adobe Photoshop. Red are pixel that differ from the photoshop version, white are equal pixels. In total 5 Images have been compared ([full results](https://dl.photoprism.app/img/docs/raw-converter/)). The diff was created using https://github.com/ewanmellor/git-diff-image.

## Adobe Photoshop / Lightroom ##

Ideally we can convert images directly with Photoshop or Lightroom, if installed. It seems like Photoshop comes with some sort of command-line automation tool based on NodeJS:
https://github.com/adobe-photoshop/generator-core

See https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/39532/command-line-approach-to-develop-raw-images-with-adobe-xmp-sidecars

This needs further investigation. Contributions welcome!
