# Thumbnail Generation and Storage

## Introduction

PhotoPrism can use `libvips` and the native [disintegration/imaging](https://github.com/disintegration/imaging) package to generate thumbnails for display in search results and in the full-screen viewer.

The smallest configurable size limit is 720px, which corresponds to the `fit_720` [thumbnail size](#standard-sizes). Most [sizes](#standard-sizes) up to 720x720 will be generated by default and should therefore always be available.

Besides their obvious use in the frontend, the indexer also uses thumbnails for color detection, face recognition and image classification, see [Advanced Settings](../../user-guide/settings/advanced.md) in the [User Guide](../../user-guide/index.md).

## Standard Sizes

The smallest configurable static and dynamic size limit is 720px, so most sizes up to `fit_720` are **always** generated by default.
[Higher size limits](../../user-guide/settings/advanced.md#preview-images) generate thumbnails with more detail at higher resolutions - either statically (pre-generated while indexing) or **on demand** if the [configuration permits](../../getting-started/config-options.md#preview-images).

**Optional** thumbnail sizes cannot be pre-generated and are only rendered on request, for example when sharing an image on Instagram.

The following overview shows the name, dimensions, and aspect ratio for each thumbnail size as well as a description of how it is used:

## Color Profiles

[sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) is the standard color space used when generating thumbnails. An [ICC color profile](colors.md#icc-profiles) for [wide-gamut displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut) can optionally be embedded.

## File Storage

Generated thumbnail files are stored in the `storage/cache/thumbnails` folder, where the path and file name depend on the [thumbnail size](#standard-sizes) and original file hash, e.g.:

```
storage/cache/thumbnails/1/a/3/1a30c1f...9_100x100_center.jpg
```

## Downscaling Filters

### Linear

Bilinear interpolation takes a weighted average of the four
neighborhood pixels to calculate its final interpolated
value. The result is a much smoother image than the original
image. When all known pixel distances are equal, then the
interpolated value is simply their sum divided by four.
This technique performs interpolation in both directions,
horizontal and vertical. This technique gives better result
than nearest neighbor interpolation and take less
computation time compared to bicubic interpolation.

### Cubic

Catmull-Rom is a local interpolating spline developed for
computer graphics purposes. Its initial use was in design
of curves and surfaces, and has recently been used in
several applications. Catmull-Rom splines are a family of
cubic interpolating splines formulated such that the
tangent at each point is calculated using the previous and
next point on the spline. The results are similar to ones
produced by bicubic interpolation with regards to
sharpness, but the Catmull-Rom reconstruction is clearly
superior in smooth signal region.

### Lanczos

The Lanczos interpolation function is a mathematical formula
used to smoothly interpolate the value of a digital
image between its samples. It maps each sample of the
given image to a translated and scaled copy of the Lanczos
kernel, which is a sinc function windowed by the central
hump of a dilated sinc function. The sum of these
translated and scaled kernels is then evaluated at the
desired pixel. Lanczos interpolation has the **best
properties in terms of detail preservation and minimal
generation of aliasing artifacts** for geometric
transformations not involving strong down sampling.
However higher order Lanczos interpolation requires high
computational time, which makes it unsuitable for
most commercial software.

### Blackman

Blackman is a modification of Lanczos that has better control of ringing artifacts.

## Server API

Like most commercial image hosting services, we have chosen to implement a **cookie-free thumbnail API** to minimize request latency by avoiding unnecessary network traffic.
