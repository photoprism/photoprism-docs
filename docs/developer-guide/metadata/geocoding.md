# Reverse Geocoding

If enabled, reverse geocoding enriches photo and video metadata with details such as country, state, city, and category.

## Privacy Policy ##

As explained in detail in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.photoprism.app/privacy), reverse geocoding depends on retrieving the necessary information from a backend that we provide for this purpose.

The costs are currently fully covered by us for all users, including non-sponsors, and we ensure a very high level of privacy and confidentiality:

- API requests are not logged permanently.
- Our API approximates the coordinates and encodes them with a [fuzzy S2 cell ID](https://s2geometry.io/resources/s2cell_statistics.html) that does not include the house number or any other data identifying a specific residential address, except possibly in very sparsely populated areas of the world. Even then, we cannot trace the request back to a person, picture or point in time.
- We may store your server's IP address and other HTTP request headers for a limited time to perform authorization checks, prevent abuse, and implement rate limits. Since the traffic is encrypted, no one intercepting the server-to-server communication can see the exact request and response; only the fact that you exchanged data with our backend.

*Other open source applications sometimes use the free developer APIs operated by [openstreetmap.org](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/). In this case, [their usage](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) and [privacy policies](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy) apply, which means that your request data is stored and used to [create publicly available reports](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/tile_logs/). This is different from our approach, which focuses on [our users' privacy](https://www.photoprism.app/privacy) and user experience.*

## Location Data ##

See: [internal/maps/location.go](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/internal/photoprism/location.go)

## World Maps ##

PhotoPrism also includes four [high-resolution world maps](https://try.photoprism.app/library/places) that allow you to browse photos by location, see [Web User Interface > Interactice Maps](../ui/maps.md). Visit [try.photoprism.app/library/places](https://try.photoprism.app/library/places) to try them on our demo.
