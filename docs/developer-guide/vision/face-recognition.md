# Face Recognition

To [recognize faces](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/organize/people/), PhotoPrism first extracts crops from your images using the [Pigo face detection library](https://github.com/esimov/pigo). It is based on [pixel intensity comparisons](https://dl.photoprism.app/pdf/publications/20140820-Pixel_Intensity_Comparisons.pdf).

These are then fed into TensorFlow to [compute 512-dimensional vectors for characterization](https://dl.photoprism.app/pdf/publications/20150101-FaceNet.pdf).

In the final step, the [DBSCAN algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) attempts to cluster these so-called face embeddings so that they can be assigned to people with a few clicks.

## Configuration

    We recommend that only advanced users and developers change these parameters.

| Environment                   | CLI Flag             | Default  | Description                                                                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_SIZE          | --face-size          | 50       | minimum size of faces in `PIXELS` (20-10000)                                           |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_SCORE         | --face-score         | 9.000000 | minimum face `QUALITY` score (1-100)                                                   |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_OVERLAP       | --face-overlap       | 42       | face area overlap threshold in `PERCENT` (1-100)                                       |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_SIZE  | --face-cluster-size  | 80       | minimum size of automatically clustered faces in `PIXELS` (20-10000) *members only*    |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_SCORE | --face-cluster-score | 15       | minimum `QUALITY` score of automatically clustered faces (1-100) *members only*        |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_CORE  | --face-cluster-core  | 4        | `NUMBER` of faces forming a cluster core (1-100) *members only*                        |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_DIST  | --face-cluster-dist  | 0.640000 | similarity `DISTANCE` of faces forming a cluster core (0.1-1.5) *members only*         |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_MATCH_DIST    | --face-match-dist    | 0.460000 | similarity `OFFSET` for matching faces with existing clusters (0.1-1.5) *members only* |

- A reasonable range for the similarity distance between face embeddings is between 0.60 and 0.70, with a higher value being more aggressive and leading to larger clusters with more false positives.
- To cluster a smaller number of faces, you can reduce the kernel to 3 or 2 similar faces.
