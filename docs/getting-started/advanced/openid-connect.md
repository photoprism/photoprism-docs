# Single Sign-On via OpenID Connect

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](../../developer-guide/api/oidc.md) allows users to log in and optionally register through an external identity provider instead of manually entering a username and password:

!!! note ""
    Your PhotoPrism instance and the [OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IdP)](#identity-providers) must be accessible **via HTTPS** and have valid TLS certificates configured for it. Please also make sure that the hostname in the [Redirect URL](#redirect-url) configured on the IdP matches the [Site URL](../../getting-started/config-options.md#site-information) used by PhotoPrism. Single sign-on via OIDC can otherwise not be enabled.

## Identity Providers

To authenticate users via OIDC, you can either set up and use a self-hosted identity provider such as [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/deploy/compose) or [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), or configure e.g. one of the following public identity providers:

- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
- [Microsoft](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
- [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/login-with-amazon)

Single sign-on can be configured automatically if [Identity Providers](#identity-providers) offer a standardized `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint for [service discovery](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-oauth-authorization-server), for example:

- <https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>

## Redirect URL

The Redirect URL that must be [specified when registering a new client](../../developer-guide/api/img/redirect-url-example.jpg) with an [Identity Provider](#identity-providers) is as follows, where `{hostname}` must be replaced by the hostname in the [Site URL](../../getting-started/config-options.md#site-information), e.g. configured via `PHOTOPRISM_SITE_URL`:

```
https://{hostname}/api/v1/oidc/redirect
```

Both URLs must begin with `https://` to use HTTPS, as otherwise single sign-on via OIDC cannot be enabled.

## Preferred Username

When a new user signs in with OpenID Connect[^1], their preferred username may already be registered. In this case, a random 6-digit number is appended to resolve the conflict.

The config option `PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_USERNAME` allows you to change the [preferred username](#config-options) for new accounts from `preferred_username` to `name`, `nickname`, or verified `email`. Names are changed to lowercase handles so that, for example, "Jens Mander" becomes "jens.mander".

## Existing Accounts

[Super admins](../../user-guide/users/roles.md) can manually connect existing user accounts under [*Settings > Users*](../../user-guide/users/index.md) by changing the authentication to *OIDC* and then setting the *Subject ID* to match the account identifier from the configured [Identity Provider](#identity-providers):

### Manually migrating accounts via CLI.

1. Log into Photoprism using OIDC to generate a new account.
2. Via CLI, run `photoprism users ls`. Take note of both your existing username, as well as your newly generated username.
3. Now run `photoprism users show your_new_username`. Copy the value in the `AuthID` column.
4. Run `photoprism users mod --auth-id 54b251266174b26e6e8c0919b4dc17be387c95a2605124200dbe9cf4a4f494a1 --auth oidc your_old_username`
5. Finally, run `photoprism users rm your_new_username`
6. You can now log into your old account using OIDC.

![Edit Dialog](../../developer-guide/api/img/oidc-subject.jpg){ class="shadow" }

The *Edit Account* dialog may additionally contain a text field for the *Issuer* URL. It does not need to be entered manually as it is set automatically after the first login.

!!! note ""
    Changing the authentication of an account to *OIDC* does not remove a previously set password, so that it can still be used to log in (optionally also in combination with [2FA](../../user-guide/users/2fa.md)). [Learn more â€º](../../known-issues.md#openid-connect-oidc)

[^1]: `PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_REGISTER` must be set to `"true"` to allow new users to create an account
