# Setup Using Docker Compose

With [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you [use a YAML file](../developer-guide/technologies/yaml.md)
to configure all application services so you can easily start them with a single command.
Before you proceed, make sure you have [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
installed on your system. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

### Step 1: Configure ###

=== "Linux"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/docker-compose.yml) example
    (right click and *Save Link As...* or use `wget`) to a folder of your choice,
    and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ``` 
    
    Commands on Linux may have to be prefixed with `sudo` when not running as root.
    Note that this will point the home directory shortcut `~` to `/root` in the `volumes:` 
    section of your `docker-compose.yml`. Kernel security modules such as AppArmor and SELinux 
    have been [reported to cause issues](troubleshooting/docker.md#kernel-security).
    Ensure that your server has [at least 4 GB of swap](troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) configured so that
    indexing doesn't cause restarts when there are memory usage spikes.

=== "Raspberry Pi"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml) example for 
    the Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 and other ARM64-based devices (right click and *Save Link As...* or use `wget`) to a folder of your choice,
    and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    Mostly the same installation instructions as for regular Linux servers apply.
    Commands may have to be prefixed with `sudo` when not running as root.
    Ensure your device meets the [requirements](raspberry-pi.md) and has
    [at least 4 GB of swap](troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) configured before you continue.

=== "ARMv7"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/armv7/docker-compose.yml) example for 
    older ARMv7-based devices (right click and *Save Link As...* or use `wget`) to a folder of your choice,
    and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/armv7/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    Mostly the same installation instructions as for regular Linux servers apply.
    Commands may have to be prefixed with `sudo` when not running as root.
    Ensure your device meets the [requirements](raspberry-pi.md) and has
    [at least 4 GB of swap](troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) configured before you continue.

=== "Windows"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/windows/docker-compose.yml) example for Windows
    (right click and *Save Link As...*) to a folder of your choice, and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
 
    [https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/windows/docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/windows/docker-compose.yml) :material-download:

    Windows Pro users should [disable](img/docker-disable-wsl2.jpg) the WSL 2 based engine in *Docker Settings > General* 
    so that they can mount drives other than `C:`. [^1] This will enable Hyper-V, which 
    [Microsoft doesn't offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements) 
    to its Windows Home customers. [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
    uses dynamic memory allocation with WSL 2. It is important to explicitly [increase the Docker memory limit to 4 GB](img/docker-resources-advanced.jpg) or more when using 
    Hyper-V. The default of 2 GB can reduce indexing performance and cause unexpected restarts.
    Also, ensure that you configure at least 4 GB of swap space.

=== "macOS"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/macos/docker-compose.yml) example for macOS
    (right click and *Save Link As...*) to a folder of your choice, and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:

    [https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/macos/docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/macos/docker-compose.yml) :material-download:
    
    It is important to [increase the Docker memory limit to 4 GB](img/docker-resources-advanced.jpg) or more,
    as the default of 2 GB can reduce indexing performance and cause unexpected restarts.
    Also, ensure that you configure at least 4 GB of swap space.

!!! danger ""
    Always change `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` so that the app starts with a **secure initial password**.
    Never use easy-to-guess passwords or default values like `insecure` on publicly accessible servers.
    There is no default in case no password was provided. A minimum length of 8 characters is required.

#### Database ####

Our example includes a pre-configured [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) database server. If you remove it 
and provide no other database server credentials, SQLite database files will be created in the 
*storage* folder. Local [SSD storage is best](troubleshooting/performance.md#storage) for databases of any kind.

Never [store database files](troubleshooting/mariadb.md#corrupted-files) on an unreliable device such as a USB flash drive, SD card, or shared network folder. These may also have [unexpected file size limitations](https://thegeekpage.com/fix-the-file-size-exceeds-the-limit-allowed-and-cannot-be-saved/), which is especially problematic for databases that do not split data into smaller files.

!!! tldr ""
    It is not possible to change the password via `MARIADB_PASSWORD` after the database has been started 
    for the first time. Choosing a secure password is not essential if you don't [expose the database to other apps and hosts](troubleshooting/mariadb.md#cannot-connect).
    To enable [automatic schema updates](troubleshooting/mariadb.md#auto-upgrade) after upgrading to a new major version, set `MARIADB_AUTO_UPGRADE` to a non-empty value in your `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Volumes ####

Since the app is running inside a container, you have to explicitly [mount the host folders](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes) you want to use.
PhotoPrism won't be able to see folders that have not been mounted. That's an important security feature.

##### /photoprism/originals #####

The *originals* folder contains your original photo and video files. 

`~/Pictures` will be mounted by default, where `~` is a shortcut for your home directory:

```yaml
volumes:
  # "/host/folder:/photoprism/folder"  # example
  - "~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"
```

You may [mount any folder accessible from the host](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#short-syntax-3)
instead, including [network drives](faq.md#how-can-i-mount-network-shares-with-docker). Additional directories can
be mounted as subfolders of `/photoprism/originals`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "/home/username/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"
  - "/example/friends:/photoprism/originals/friends"
  - "/mnt/photos:/photoprism/originals/media"
```

On Windows, prefix the host path with the drive letter and use `/` instead of `\` as separator:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "D:/Example/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"
```

!!! tldr ""
    If *read-only mode* is enabled, all features that require write permission to the *originals* folder 
    are disabled, e.g. [WebDAV](../user-guide/sync/webdav.md), uploading and deleting files. Set `PHOTOPRISM_READONLY` to `"true"`
    in `docker-compose.yml` for this. You can [mount a folder with the `:ro` flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#short-syntax-3) to make Docker block 
    write operations as well.

##### /photoprism/storage #####

Cache, session, thumbnail and sidecar files are created in the *storage* folder:

- a *storage* folder mount must always be configured in your `docker-compose.yml` file so that you do not lose these files after a restart or upgrade
- never configure the *storage* folder to be inside the *originals* folder unless the name starts with a `.` to indicate that it is hidden
- we recommend placing the *storage* folder on a [local SSD drive](troubleshooting/performance.md#storage) for best performance
- mounting [symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) or using them inside the *storage* folder is currently not supported

!!! tldr ""
    Should you later want to move your instance to another host, the easiest and most time-saving way is to copy the entire *storage* folder along with your originals and database.

##### /photoprism/import #####

You may optionally mount an *import* folder from which files can be transferred to the *originals* folder
in a structured way that avoids duplicates. Imported files receive a canonical filename and will be
organized by year and month.

!!! tldr ""
    You can safely skip this. Adding files via [Web Upload](../user-guide/library/upload.md)
    and [WebDAV](../user-guide/sync/webdav.md) remains possible, unless [read-only mode](config-options.md)
    is enabled or the [features have been disabled](../user-guide/settings/general.md).

### Step 2: Start the server ###

Open a terminal and change to the folder in which the `docker-compose.yml` file has been saved.[^2]
Run this command to start the application and database services in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

!!! info ""
    if you are using docker compose V2 remove the "-" from the command, so run:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ``` 
    ([see this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1396689/docker-compose-cant-execute-command-docker-compose-not-found))


Now open the Web UI by navigating to http://localhost:2342/. You should see a login screen.
Sign in with the user `admin` and the initial password configured via `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
You may change it on the [account settings page](../user-guide/settings/account.md).
Enabling [public mode](config-options.md) will disable authentication.

!!! info ""
    It can be helpful to [keep Docker running in the foreground while debugging](troubleshooting/docker.md#viewing-logs) so that log messages are displayed directly. To do this, omit the `-d` parameter when restarting.

    Should the server already be running, or you see no errors, you may have started it
    on a different host and/or port. There could also be an [issue with your browser,
    ad blocker, or firewall settings](troubleshooting/index.md#connection-fails).

!!! tldr ""
    It is not possible to change the password via `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` after the app has been 
    started for the first time. You may run `docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism passwd` 
    in a terminal to change an existing password. You can also reset your database for a clean start.

The server port and other [config options](config-options.md) can be changed in `docker-compose.yml` at any time.
Remember to restart the services for changes to take effect:

```bash
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Index Your Library ###

Our [First Steps 👣](../user-guide/first-steps.md) tutorial guides you through the user interface and settings to ensure your library is indexed according to your individual preferences.

<!--
!!! note ""
    Ensure [there is enough disk space available](troubleshooting/docker.md#disk-space) for creating thumbnails and [verify filesystem permissions](troubleshooting/docker.md#file-permissions)
    before starting to index: Files in the *originals* folder must be readable, while the *storage* folder
    including all subdirectories must be readable and writeable.

Open the Web UI, go to *Library* and click *Start* to start indexing your pictures.

While indexing, JPEG sidecar files may be created for originals in other formats such as RAW and HEIF. 
This is required for image classification, facial recognition, and for displaying them in a Web browser. 
Sidecar and thumbnail files will be added to the *storage* folder, so that your *originals* folder won't be modified.

Your [photos](../user-guide/organize/browse.md) and [videos](../user-guide/organize/video.md) will 
successively become visible in search results and other parts of the user interface. 
Open the *Logs* tab in *Library* to watch the indexer working.

Of course, you can continue using your favorite tools for processing RAW files, editing metadata, 
or importing new shots. Go to *Library* and click *Start* to update the index after files have been 
changed, added, or removed. This can also be automated using CLI commands and a [scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/scheduler/).-->

Easy, isn't it?

### Troubleshooting ###

If your server runs out of memory, the index is frequently locked, or other system resources are running low:

- [ ] Try [reducing the number of workers](config-options.md#index-workers) by setting `PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS` to a reasonably small value in `docker-compose.yml`, depending on the CPU performance and number of cores
- [ ] Make sure [your server has at least 4 GB of swap space](troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) so that indexing doesn't cause restarts when memory usage spikes; RAW image conversion and video transcoding are especially demanding
- [ ] If you are using SQLite, switch to MariaDB, which is [better optimized for high concurrency](faq.md#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql)
- [ ] As a last measure, you can [disable the use of TensorFlow](config-options.md#feature-flags) for image classification and facial recognition

    Before [submitting a support request](index.md#getting-support), try to [determine the cause of your problem](troubleshooting/index.md).

### Command-Line Interface ###

`photoprism help` lists all commands and [config options](config-options.md) available in the current version:

```bash
docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism help
```

Use the `--help` flag to see a detailed command description, for example:

```bash
docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup --help
```

!!! tip ""
    When using *Docker Compose*, you can prepend commands like `docker-compose exec [service] [command]` to run them in a service container.
    Should this fail with *no container found*, make sure the service has been started, you have specified an existing service (usually `photoprism`) and you are in the folder where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

PhotoPrism's command-line interface is well suited for job automation using a
[scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/scheduler/).

    `docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index -f` rescans all originals, including already indexed and unchanged files.
    This may be necessary after major upgrades and after migrations of the database schema, especially if search results are missing or incorrect. Note you can also start a [rescan from the user interface](../user-guide/library/originals.md) by navigating to *Library* > *Index*, checking "Full Rescan" and then clicking "Start".

[^2]: The default [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) config filename is `docker-compose.yml`. For simplicity, it doesn't need to be specified when running the `docker-compose` command in the same directory. Config files for other apps or instances should be placed in separate folders.
