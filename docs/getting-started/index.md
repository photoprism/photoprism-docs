# Setup

PhotoPrism can be installed on all operating systems supporting [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community), as well as [FreeBSD](ports/freebsd.md), [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md), and many [NAS devices](nas/synology.md). It is also available in the cloud on [PikaPods](cloud/pikapods.md) and [DigitalOcean](cloud/digitalocean.md).

We recommend running PhotoPrism with [Docker Compose](docker-compose.md) when hosting it on a private server. It is available for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Linux](troubleshooting/docker.md#installation), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

Once the initial setup is complete, our [First Steps ðŸ‘£](../user-guide/first-steps.md) tutorial guides you through the user interface and settings to ensure your library is indexed according to your individual preferences.

    [Our stable releases](../release-notes.md) and [preview builds](updates.md#development-preview) are available as [multi-arch Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism/tags) for 64-bit AMD, Intel, and ARM processors. Experienced users can [alternatively use the packages](faq.md#installation-packages) at [dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html) to manually install PhotoPrism on compatible Linux distributions. For more installation methods, see our [Getting Started FAQ](faq.md#how-can-i-install-photoprism-without-docker).

## System Requirements

You should host PhotoPrism on a server with **at least 2 cores**, **3 GB of physical memory**,[^1] and a 64-bit operating system. Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should [match the number of CPU cores](troubleshooting/performance.md#memory). Indexing large photo and video collections also benefits greatly from [local SSD storage](troubleshooting/performance.md#storage), especially for the database and cache files.

Also ensure that your server has [at least 4 GB of swap](troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) configured and avoid setting a [hard memory limit](faq.md#why-is-my-configured-memory-limit-exceeded-when-indexing-even-though-photoprism-doesnt-actually-seem-to-use-that-much-memory) as this can cause unexpected restarts when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files. Indexing [RAW images and high-resolution panoramas](troubleshooting/performance.md#memory) may require additional [swap space](troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) and/or physical memory beyond the recommended minimum.

!!! tldr ""
    We take no responsibility for instability or performance problems if your device does not meet the requirements.

#### Databases ####

PhotoPrism is compatible with [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/) and [MariaDB 10.5.12+](https://mariadb.org/).[^2] Note that [SQLite is generally not a good choice](troubleshooting/sqlite.md) for users who require scalability and high performance, and that support for [MySQL 8 has been discontinued](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1764) due to low demand and missing features.[^3]

#### Browsers ####

Built as a [Progressive Web App](../user-guide/pwa.md) (PWA), the web interface works with most modern browsers, and runs best on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release), and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).
You can conveniently install it on the home screen of all major operating systems and mobile devices.

Browsers must have [WebGL support](https://caniuse.com/?search=webgl) enabled in order to use the [interactive world maps](https://demo.photoprism.app/library/places) in [Places](../user-guide/organize/places.md).[^4] Also note that not all [video and audio formats](https://caniuse.com/?search=video%20format) can be [played with every browser](troubleshooting/browsers.md). For example, [AAC](https://caniuse.com/aac "Advanced Audio Coding") - the default audio codec for [MPEG-4 AVC / H.264](https://caniuse.com/avc "Advanced Video Coding") - is supported natively in Chrome, Safari, and Edge, while it is only optionally supported by the OS in Firefox and Opera.

#### HTTPS ####

If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, **always run it behind a secure HTTPS reverse proxy** such as [Traefik](proxies/traefik.md) or [Caddy](proxies/caddy-2.md).
Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments. Backup tools and file sync apps like [FolderSync](https://foldersync.io/docs/faq/#https-connection-errors) may refuse to connect as well.

#### Firewall ####

In order to successfully set up your installation and view location details in PhotoPrism, you must [allow incoming requests as well as those to our Geocoding API and Docker](troubleshooting/firewall.md) if you have a firewall installed, and make sure that your Internet connection is working.

[Configure Firewall â€º](troubleshooting/firewall.md)

## Maps & Places

As explained in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.photoprism.app/privacy#section-7), reverse geocoding and interactive world maps depend on retrieving the necessary information [from us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) and [MapTiler AG](https://www.maptiler.com/contacts/), headquartered in Switzerland. Both services are provided with a very high level of privacy and confidentiality.[^5]

Your use of these services is [fully covered by us](faq.md#are-the-keys-for-using-interactive-world-maps-provided-free-of-charge). Depending on your usage, this can save you much more than the cost of a [PhotoPrism+ Membership](https://www.photoprism.app/membership), since other providers generally charge usage-based fees and often don't allow you to cache the data they provide, compromising performance and your privacy with unnecessary requests.

## Roadmap

Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible. The [project roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress, what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.

Please note, however, that we have a [zero-bug policy](../known-issues.md) and do our best to help users when they need support or have questions. This comes at a price, as we can't give exact release dates for new features.

## Getting Support

    **We kindly ask you not to report bugs via *GitHub Issues* unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue that must be fixed directly in the app.**

    if you need help, it could be a configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works.

[^1]: RAW image conversion and TensorFlow are disabled on systems with 1 GB or less memory
[^2]: Our [configuration examples](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/) are generally based on the [current stable MariaDB version](https://mariadb.com/docs/release-notes/community-server) to take advantage of performance improvements. This does not mean that older versions are no longer supported and you must upgrade immediately. We recommend not using the `:latest` tag for the MariaDB Docker image and to upgrade manually by changing the tag once we had a chance to test a new major version.
[^3]: Oracle seems to have stopped shipping [new features and enhancements](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1764). As a result, the testing effort required before each release is no longer feasible.
[^4]: [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/?search=webgl) may not be fully supported by some versions of Firefox, especially on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en&pli=1).
[^5]: Our [Compliance FAQ](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/compliance-faq#privacy) provides answers to the most frequently asked questions about product compliance and scalability.
