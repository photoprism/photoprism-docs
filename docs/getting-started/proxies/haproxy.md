# Using HAPROXY as Reverse Proxy

!!! tldr ""
    Should you experience problems with Haproxy, we recommend that you ask the Haproxy community for advice, as we cannot provide support for third-party software and services.

## Why Use a Proxy? ##

If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, **always run it behind a secure
HTTPS reverse proxy**. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted in clear text and can be intercepted
by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments. Backup tools and file sync apps may refuse to
connect as well.
