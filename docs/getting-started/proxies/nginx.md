# Using NGINX as Reverse Proxy

!!! danger "Getting Support"
    Since [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is [notoriously difficult](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+nginx) to configure, we unfortunately can't offer you support in case something isn't working. If you have NGINX related issues such as failed uploads, [connection errors](../troubleshooting/index.md#connection-fails), [broken thumbnails](../troubleshooting/index.md#broken-thumbnails), and [video playback problems](../troubleshooting/index.md#videos-dont-play), we recommend that you [ask the NGINX community for advice](https://www.nginx.com/support/) or try to [use Traefik as a reverse proxy](traefik.md), as it is easier to configure and much more convenient to work with overall.

This [tutorial](https://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/web-servers-linux/how-to-configure-nginx-for-websockets/) explains, how to configure NGINX WebSocket connections between your client and backend services.

!!! example
    ```
     # If you want to make sure your port 80 gets redirected to a secure line (Uncomment this after you have obtained your LetsEncrypt cert!) :
     # server {
     #   listen 80 default;
     #   listen [::]:80 default;
     #   server_name domain.tld;
     #   return 307 https://domain.tld$request_uri;
     # }
     
     server {
        listen  443 ssl;
        listen  [::]:443 ssl;
        server_name domain.tld abc.domain.tld www.domain.tld;
        client_max_body_size 500M;
    
        # With SSL via Let's Encrypt
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

        location / {
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
    
          proxy_pass http://localhost:2342;
    
          proxy_buffering off;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          
          client_max_body_size 500M;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

At the very least you will need to adapt `server_name` and the `ssl_certificate`/`ssl_certificate_key` paths to match your setup. Please refer to their [official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) for further details.

### Why Use a Proxy? ###

If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, **always run it behind a secure
HTTPS reverse proxy**. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted in clear text and can be intercepted
by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments. Backup tools and file sync apps may refuse to
connect as well.
