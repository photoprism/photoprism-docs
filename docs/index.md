# PhotoPrism: Browse Your Life in Pictures

PhotoPrism™ is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud.

## Getting Started ##

You're welcome to play with our demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org).
Leave your email to get a [release notification](https://goo.gl/forms/KBPVGl9PCsOKrAv33).

Step-by-step installation instructions can be found on [docs.photoprism.org](getting-started/index.md) - 
all you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Next, you'll have to [index or import](user-guide/library/import-vs-index.md) 
existing files. Please be patient, this will take a while depending on the size of your library.

Already indexed photos can be browsed in [Photos](user-guide/organize/browse.md) 
while videos show up in [Videos](user-guide/organize/video.md).
Counts are continuously updated in the navigation.

If photos are missing, they might be in [review](user-guide/organize/review.md) due to low quality or missing metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](user-guide/settings/ui.md), depending on
your specific use case.
