<span class="build">Build 240528-977d6c0de</span>

This service release reduces the server load when [downloading many files](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/4298), expands the list of [available config options](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/), and gets you the latest translations [contributed by our community](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/translations-weblate/).

### May 23, 2024
<span class="build">Build 240523-923ee0cf7</span>

This update adds a scheduler so you can [easily create database backups](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#backup) and [re-index your library](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#indexing) at regular intervals. It also includes [many updated dependencies](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/4084#issuecomment-2112733848) and [support for ICC color profiles](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#preview-images), which especially benefits Apple iPhone and professional users working with color spaces other than sRGB. üé®

Important Changes

- If you keep the [default settings](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#backup), daily database backups will be automatically created, with up to 3 backup files being retained. This is to prevent the available storage space from filling up. We recommend [setting the corresponding config options](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#backup) before installing the update if you want to disable scheduled backups, keep more backup files, or prefer a specific time for creating backups. The previously available `--disable-backups` flag has been deprecated in favor of [these finer-grained options](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#backup).
- In order to preserve ICC color profiles and reduce memory usage, new thumbnails will be [generated with the `libvips` image processing library](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1474). You can run the `photoprism thumbs -f` [command in a terminal](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface) to regenerate your existing thumbs as needed, or delete the `storage/cache/thumbnails` folder and then re-index your library. To continue using the native image processing library, set `PHOTOPRISM_THUMB_LIBRARY` to `"imaging"` in your `compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml` [configuration file](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/#preview-images). If you [build from source](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#building-from-source) or use one of our [binary installation packages](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html), the system on which you build and/or run PhotoPrism must have `libvips` >= 8.10 installed.

What's new?

- Colors: [Added libvips support to preserve ICC profiles in thumbnails](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1474)
- Search: [Clicking on a timestamp finds pictures taken on the same day](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/4273)

### April 20, 2024

### November 2, 2022
<span class="build">Build 221102-905925b4d</span>

Due to the many new features, enhancements and bug fixes, this is one of those updates that took longer to release.
Before upgrading, please read the full release notes and note that this release does not yet include support for user roles other than *Admin*, as we need to specify, create and test each new role before we can release it. Once this is done, we will also provide additional user management documentation.

!!! example ""
    We've generated missing translations with the help of DeepL and Google Translate. Native speakers are
    invited to [help us improve those if needed](developer-guide/translations-weblate.md).
    A special thank you to [everyone who contributed](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/)!

Breaking Changes

- In order to improve security and compatibility, the default Docker image is now based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) instead of Debian 12 (Bookworm). The entrypoint script has been updated to [preserve group permissions required for hardware transcoding](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2739).
- Session and user management have been re-implemented. **If you are upgrading from a preview build, you will need to run the `photoprism users reset --yes` [command in a terminal](getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) after the upgrade to recreate the new database tables so that they are compatible with the stable version. This will not affect your pictures or albums.**
- Upgrading from the last stable version should work without any problems. However, if you have already created additional accounts with the previously offered unofficial multi-user support, you will notice that only the main admin account is migrated automatically. Run `photoprism users legacy` [in a terminal](getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) to display the legacy accounts so you can migrate them manually if needed.
- Sharing link visitors can now see the picture locations in the regular album view and optionally on a map after clicking the link. Based on user feedback, we may add settings to hide the locations for enhanced privacy.
- We recommend performing a full rescan after the upgrade to take advantage of new search filters and sort options.
- Indexing is also necessary to find and view HEIC, DNG, and AVIF images that were previously unsupported or had errors. In some cases with incorrectly converted images, it may be necessary to recreate the JPEG sidecar files by running the `photoprism convert -f` command [in a terminal](getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) before starting the rescan. To regenerate your thumbnails, run `photoprism thumbs -f`.

PhotoPrism is not directly affected by the [Apache Log4j](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/12/log4j-zero-day-log4shell-arrives-just-in-time-to-ruin-your-weekend) vulnerability.
Logs may still contain messages that can cause harm if consumed by an unpatched Java application.
As a precaution, this release includes additional [rules and filters to validate user input](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1814).

- Sharing: [Fixed album link redirect on shared domains](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1617)

### December 10, 2021
<span class="build">Build 211210-2cb90e7e</span>

Starting with this release, the [regular multi-arch Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism/tags?name=latest) is 64-bit only. 
A 32-bit version of our stable release for [older devices](getting-started/raspberry-pi.md#older-armv7-based-devices) 
is offered separately. This frees up development and infrastructure resources with minimal impact.

- Security: [Updated Go to v1.17.5, which includes HTTP/2 and networking fixes](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/hcmEScgc00k)
- People: [Concurrent updates are no longer possible to prevent inconsistencies](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/1b583e071e80b68352b1b366d60e010d8f8f9535)

### December 3, 2021
<span class="build">Build 211203-fdb6b5e1</span>

Since the [funding goal](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsor) required to make all features and maps generally
available has not been reached, *early-access features* have been renamed to *sponsor features* in this update.
Offline and high-resolution street maps remain free for everyone, while hybrid, topographic, and outdoor maps are 
now a member feature. We believe this is fair. A big thank you to all our [sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsors)
and [contributors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/graphs/contributors/)!

- CLI: [Improved parameter](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1778) and [command descriptions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1735)
- CLI: [Reset command optionally also deletes files in the cache folder](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1787)

### November 28, 2021
<span class="build">Build 211128-7e8974fd</span>

Official support for MySQL 8 is discontinued with this update as Oracle seems to have stopped shipping [new features and enhancements](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1764).
As a result, the testing effort required before each release is no longer feasible. We recommend [upgrading](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/#version-upgrade)
to [MariaDB 10.6](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/function-differences-between-mariadb-106-and-mysql-80/) or later.
PostgreSQL support is [planned for 2022](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/47) without a specific release date yet.

- CLI: [`photoprism migrations run --failed` will re-run previously failed migrations](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/7e8974fd20fcbf3ec403541125599deaeb1ee353)

### November 27, 2021
<span class="build">Build 211127-86c43159</span>

When possible, location estimates now include a latitude and longitude. Photos load faster when you open 
them in *Places*, and the viewer sorts them by distance. Time zone handling has been completely reworked, 
in particular for UTC. The Docker base image has been updated to Ubuntu 21.10, which ships with 
Darktable 3.6 among other updated dependencies.

### Getting Updates

Even when you use an image with the `:latest` tag, Docker does not automatically download new images for you. To update, you can either [manually pull the newest image](getting-started/updates.md) and restart, or set up a service like [Watchtower](getting-started/updates.md#watchtower) to get automatic updates.
