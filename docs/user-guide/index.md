Step-by-step installation instructions can be found in [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md).
All you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Next, you'll have to [index or import](library/import-vs-index.md) existing photos and videos.
Please be patient, this will take a while depending on the number of files.

Already indexed photos can be browsed in [Photos](organize/browse.md) while videos show up in [Videos](organize/video.md).
Counts are continuously updated in the navigation.

If photos are missing, they might be in [review](organize/review.md) due to low quality or missing metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](settings/ui.md), depending on
your specific use case.
