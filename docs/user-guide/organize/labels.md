# Labels #
PhotoPrism uses labels to classify images.
Other tools use the term tags instead of labels.
Labels are set automatically when adding new photos. 
You can manually add new labels or edit/remove the ones that have been created by us.

In *Labels* you find all labels of your photos and videos. 
You can star labels by clicking :material-star:. Starred labels will be listed first.

PhotoPrism also attaches each generated label to a broader group (or category) of labels. For example, there is a general category 'vehicle' which will include labels such as 'cab', 'catamaran', 'lifeboat' and 'bullet train'. These broad label categories cannot be edited, but can be used in a search, in an identical way to all other labels.

You may wish to see these broad label categories in addition to the usual labels in the *Labels* pages. Clicking the icon in the upper right-hand corner will switch between turning them on :material-unfold-more-horizontal: ('Show More') and off :material-unfold-less-horizontal: ('Show Less'). You can also include these label categories as part of a more complex search filter - the label categories from your photos will appear in the search filter bar as a drop-down selection under the option 'All Categories'.
