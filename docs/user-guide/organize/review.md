# Reviewing Non-Photographic and Low-Quality Images #
When adding new photos a quality score from 1 to 5 is created automatically.
Photos with a quality score lower than 3 do not appear in *Photos* until you approve them (unless the quality filter was disabled
in [*Settings*](../settings/general.md))

The quality score depends on the following:

* Known date and/or GPS coordinates
* At least 2 MP resolution if taken after 2012
* Photo not classified as info or screenshot
* Photo is favorite, was edited or approved
