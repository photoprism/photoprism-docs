# Rotate Image #

!!! info ""
    This feature will be available soon in our next stable release.

PhotoPrism allows you to rotate JPG and PNG images.

1. Open the photo [*edit dialog*](edit.md)
2. Go to the *Files* tab
3. Click on the orientation icon and choose the correct orientation

![Screenshot](img/rotate-1.jpg){ class="shadow" }

![Screenshot](img/rotate-2.jpg){ class="shadow" }

The updated orientation is stored in the metadata of your original file. Therefore, it is not possible to rotate images in read-only mode at this time.
