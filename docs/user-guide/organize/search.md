# Search #
In all sections you can use the *search bar* to find certain photos, videos, albums or labels.

You can search for all kind of things:

* People on the photo
* Objects that are displayed on the photo
* The main color of the photo
* The filename or foldername of a photo
* Location where the photo has been taken
* ...

Just try it!

## Search Filter ##
Additionally to the search you can set the following filters using the filter bar:

* Country, Year, Order, Camera, Lens, Color, Category

In case you set multiple filters only photos, that fulfill all filter criteria, are shown in the search result.

## AND Search ##
To combine different filters use a space as separator:

```
mono:true review:false
```

The search result shows photos that are monochrome **and** not in review.

Additionally some filters can be used with &:

```bigquery
keywords:buffalo&water
```

Or:

```bigquery
keywords:"buffalo & water"
```

This query will show all photos that have the keywords water **and** buffalo.

& is supported by the following filters:

* albums, keywords, subject/person, subjects/people.

!!!info ""
    The label filter does not support &. You can use the keywords filter instead, as all labels are keywords as well.

## OR Search ##
An OR search is possible using `|`:

```
label:cat|dog
```

This will show all photos that have either the label cat **or** dog.

The following filters work with |:

* albums, color, country, day, month, year, keywords, label, path, state, subject/person, subjects/people, title, type, name, filename, original, hash

## Wildcard ##
The `*` character will act as a wildcard:

```
name:"IMG_23*"
```

This will show all photos which name start with `IMG_23`.


```
name:"*_23*"
```

This will show all photos which name contain `_23`, like `IMG_2356.MOV` , `2021_02_23.jpg`, etc.

!!!info ""
    Wildcards can be combined with & or |: `filename:"*IMG123*|*_22F6FC19.jpg"`
