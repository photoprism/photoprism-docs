## User Interface ##
You can change the *theme* and *language* of the User interface.

To make PhotoPrism suit your individual needs, the following sections and functionalities can be en- or disabled.
Disabled sections do not appear in the main navigation.

#### :material-cloud-upload: Upload ####
When disabled, uploading files via [*upload*](../library/upload.md) is not possible. 
This might be useful when you grant others access to your PhotoPrism but do not want them to upload photos.

#### :material-download: Download ####
When disabled, no files can be downloaded using the PhotoPrism UI. Please note that it may still be possible to download files using the integrated browser functionalities.

#### :material-share-variant: Share ####
When disabled, album sharing and upload to remote services like ownCloud is not possible.

#### :material-account: People ####
When disabled, the people section is hidden. To disable face detection while indexing, you may set `PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_FACES` and/or `PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_TENSORFLOW` to `"true"` in your [config](../../getting-started/config-options.md).

#### :material-lock: Hide Private ####
Excludes content marked as private from search results, shared albums, labels and places.

## Places ##

At the bottom of the *General* settings tab, you may choose your preferred map style and animation length for *Places*.
PhotoPrism includes four high-resolution world maps to see where you've been, and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.

To enhance your photos with location data such as state, city and category, we've also launched our own geo-information service based on OpenStreetMap.
A future release will additionally provide public events' data, so that albums of popular music festivals, or sports gatherings, can be created automatically.

## Downloads ##

!!! info ""
    Note that your choice will not affect ZIP archives when you download complete albums. However, we may add settings for this in a future release.

#### :material-camera-iris: Originals ####
Only the files in the *originals* folder will be downloaded, but not any files that were automatically created in the *sidecar* folder. This is the recommended default.

#### :material-raw: RAW ####
Download RAW image files.

#### :material-paperclip: Sidecar ####
Download sidecar files as used for XMP metadata. This is generally not recommended except for some professional workflows.
