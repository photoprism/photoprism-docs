# Services

You can connect your PhotoPrism instance to other services with WebDAV support, such as other PhotoPrism instances, Nextcloud or ownCloud.

This might be useful if you want to [share](../share/services-share.md) or [synchronize](../sync/services-sync.md) files between multiple services.

!!! tldr ""
    Since they are not safe to use without authentication, these settings are not available when running in [public mode](../../getting-started/config-options.md#authentication).

!!! note ""
    PhotoPrism can also serve/share files via WebDAV to be browsed on macOS or Windows.
    See [instructions](../sync/webdav.md).
