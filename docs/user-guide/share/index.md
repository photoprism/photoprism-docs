# Sharing Albums via Link #
Create sharing links to share albums, moments, calendar months, states or folders with your friends.

Your friends are able to view and download photos from shared albums.
Photos marked as private won't show up.

Clicking :material-power: allows link visitors to end their session.

Support for optional password protection of sharing links as well as other enhancements are [planned](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sharing+in%3Atitle+label%3Aidea).
