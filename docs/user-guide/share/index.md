# Creating and Sharing Album Links

Secret links make it easy to share [manually created albums](../organize/albums.md) as well as selected [Moments](../organize/moments.md), [Months](../organize/calendar.md), [States](../search/index.md#states), or [Folders](../organize/folders.md) with your loved ones. You can [create multiple links](#create-sharing-link) for each album and optionally set an expiration date. While no registration is required to use the links, [sharing albums with users who have an account](../users/sharing.md) is also possible this way.

When you share an album, pictures marked as private will not be visible to others. They can view and download the non-private pictures, but they cannot modify them or their metadata.

    When link visitors click on the location of a photo, they can view the photos of the shared album in the map view

Clicking :material-power: allows link visitors to end their session.

Support for optional password protection of sharing links as well as other enhancements are [planned](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sharing+in%3Atitle+label%3Aidea).
