# Syncing with other WebDAV-compatible Apps and Services

Under [Settings > Services](../settings/sync.md) you can connect your PhotoPrism instance to other apps and services that can be accessed via WebDAV, e.g. other PhotoPrism instances, Nextcloud or ownCloud.

    When syncing, your files will be uploaded or downloaded to/from another service, which requires additional storage space. If you want PhotoPrism to index files from another local application, e.g. Nextcloud, we recommend mounting its file storage directory as [*originals* folder](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#photoprismoriginals) instead of synchronizing the files via WebDAV. This prevents unnecessary copies of your files from being created.

## Automatically Upload/Download Files to/from another App

1. Go to *Settings*
2. Open *Services* tab
3. Click into the sync cell of your service
