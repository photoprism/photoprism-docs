# User Management Commands

## Changing a Password

Running the following in a terminal changes the password of an existing user without affecting other account settings, e.g. if you cannot remember the currently set password or if there was a problem [configuring the initial admin account](../../getting-started/config-options.md#authentication) (replace `[username]` with the username of the account you want to update):

```bash
photoprism passwd [username]
```

Note that when you use [Docker Compose](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) and do not [already have a terminal session open](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#opening-a-terminal), you must prepend `docker compose exec photoprism` so that the command is executed within the `photoprism` container, for example:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism passwd admin
```

This also [applies to other terminal commands](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#examples), including those listed below.

!!! tldr ""
    The examples in our documentation use the new `docker compose` command by default. If your server does not yet support it, you can still use `docker-compose` or alternatively `podman-compose` on Red Hat-compatible distributions.

## Removing a Password

Changing the authentication of an existing account to a password-less provider like [*OIDC*](../../getting-started/advanced/openid-connect.md) will not remove a previously set password, so it can still be used to log in (optionally also with [2FA](2fa.md)).

If a local password has been set for [such an account](../../getting-started/advanced/openid-connect.md#existing-accounts) that should no longer be used, you can remove it by running the following command [in a terminal](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#opening-a-terminal):

```bash
photoprism passwd --rm [username]
```

## Managing User Accounts

As an alternative to the [web user interface](index.md), you can [run the following commands in a terminal](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) to perform tasks such as adding, viewing, editing and deleting user accounts:

| CLI Command                                 | Description                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `photoprism users ls [options] [search]`    | Searches existing user accounts              |
| `photoprism users legacy [options] [search]`  | Searches legacy user accounts                |
| `photoprism users add [options] [username]` | Adds a new user account                      |
| `photoprism users show [options] [username]`  | Displays user account information            |
| `photoprism users mod [options] [username]`   | Modifies an existing user account            |
| `photoprism users rm [options] [username]`   | Removes a user account                       |
| `photoprism users reset --yes`              | Removes all accounts and resets the database |

To get a list of all possible options run the commands with `--help` flag.

!!! tldr ""
    Users who experience login problems after upgrading from [development builds](../../getting-started/updates.md#development-preview), or [old releases prior to November 2022](../../known-issues.md#new-user-management), can run the `photoprism users reset --yes` command to [recreate the session](#session-management) and user management database tables so they are compatible with the current version. Note that any [client access tokens](client-credentials.md#access-tokens) and [app passwords](../settings/account.md#apps-and-devices) that users may have created will also be deleted and must be recreated.

### Command Options

The `users add` and `users mod` commands support these flags to set or change account properties:

| Command Flag                         | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--name NAME`, `-n NAME`             | full NAME for display in the interface                              |
| `--email EMAIL`, `-m EMAIL`          | unique EMAIL address of the user                                    |
| `--password PASSWORD`, `-p PASSWORD` | PASSWORD for local authentication (8-72 characters)                 |
| `--role value`, `-r value`           | user account ROLE (admin, user, viewer or guest) (default: "admin") |
| `--auth PROVIDER`, `-A PROVIDER`     | authentication PROVIDER (default, local, oidc or none)              |
| `--auth-id ID`                       | authentication ID e.g. Subject ID or Distinguished Name (DN)        |
| `--superadmin`, `-s`                 | make user super admin with full access                              |
| `--no-login`, `-l`                   | disable login on the web interface                                  |
| `--webdav`, `-w`                     | allow to sync files via WebDAV                                      |
| `--upload-path value`, `-u value`    | upload files to this sub-folder                                     |
| `--disable-2fa`                      | deactivate two-factor authentication                                |

### Creating a New Account

The `photoprism users add` command creates a new user account or offers to restore a previously deleted account with the same *username* if it exists. For example, you can run the following to add a new admin account with the username "bob" and the password "mysecret":

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism users add -p mysecret -n "Bob" bob
```

If you do not specify an initial password with the `-p` flag, you will be prompted to enter a password for the new account. Further account properties can be set with the flags listed above.

!!! example ""
    Some user [account roles](roles.md#user) such as *User* and *Viewer* are currently [only available with a membership](https://www.photoprism.app/editions#compare) to support development and maintenance.

### Viewing Account Details

To view the account properties of a specific user, use the `show` subcommand:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism users show bob
```

### Searching User Accounts

To list all existing accounts, you can run the following:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism users ls
```

With the `photoprism users ls` command, you can also find specific accounts based on a search term you provide:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism users ls bob
```

To display a description and the available options for a command, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism users ls --help
```

## Viewing Login Attempts

For security reasons, the authentication logs are not accessible from the web user interface. They can only be viewed in the application service logs or by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism audit logins [username]
```

### Command Options

You can combine it with these flags to change the output format and the maximum number of search results:

| Command Flag | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--md, -m`   | format as machine-readable Markdown    |
| `--csv, -c`  | export as semicolon separated values   |
| `--tsv, -t`  | export as tab separated values         |
| `-n LIMIT`   | LIMIT number of results (default: 100) |

### Example Report

| Client IP  | Username | Realm | Status |     Last Login      | Failed At |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| 172.19.0.1 | user     | api   | OK     | 2023-02-03 07:17:46 |           |

    Run `photoprism audit reset --yes` to clear all audit logs and reset the database table to a clean state.

## Session Management

You can use the following terminal commands to generate, inspect and, if necessary, delete access tokens for the authentication of browsers and other clients (including [app passwords](2fa.md#step-3-app-passwords)):

| CLI Command                         | Description                                              |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `photoprism auth ls [search]`       | Lists currently authenticated users and clients          |
| `photoprism auth add [username]`    | Adds a new authentication secret for client applications |
| `photoprism auth show [identifier]` | Shows detailed information about a session               |
| `photoprism auth rm [identifier]`   | Deletes a session by id or access token                  |
| `photoprism auth reset --yes`       | Resets the authentication of all users and clients       |

In order to grant limited API access to other applications and services, the `photoprism clients add` command lets you generate [OAuth2 client credentials](client-credentials.md#client-credentials) for them, or you can use the `photoprism auth add` command to [generate access tokens](client-credentials.md#access-tokens) with a [limited scope](client-credentials.md#authorization-scopes) and lifetime.

    Should you experience login problems, for example after upgrading from a [previous release](../../release-notes.md) or [development preview](../../getting-started/updates.md#development-preview), we recommend running the `photoprism auth reset --yes` command [in a terminal](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) to reset the `auth_sessions` table to a clean state and force a re-login of all users. Note that any [client access tokens](client-credentials.md#access-tokens) and [app passwords](../settings/account.md#apps-and-devices) that users may have created will also be deleted and must be recreated.
