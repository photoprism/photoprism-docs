# Authenticating External Apps and Services

In order to grant limited access to other applications and services, administrators can use the [`photoprism auth`](cli.md#session-management) and [`photoprism clients`](#client-credentials) subcommands to generate authentication tokens for them. While [App Passwords](#app-passwords) are bound to user accounts and can be [generated by anyone](../settings/account.md#apps-and-devices) from the UI, OAuth2 [Access Tokens](#access-tokens) and [Client Credentials](#client-credentials) can be used to [access the REST API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/photoprism/photoprism/internal/api) without being bound to an account.

## App Passwords

All users can generate app-specific passwords for their own use from the web interface by navigating to [*Settings > Account*](../settings/account.md) and then clicking the [*Apps and Devices*](../settings/account.md#apps-and-devices) button.

Alternatively, running the following command [in a terminal](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) will generate a new app-specific password e.g. for the *admin* account, so that WebDAV-compatible clients can synchronize files even if [2FA is enabled for the account](2fa.md) or the [account password is changed](../settings/account.md#change-password):

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism auth add -n Sync -s "webdav" admin
```

You will then be shown the generated app password so you can copy it and keep it in a safe place or enter it directly into an app, as you will not be able to see it again:

```
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| App Password                | Authorization Scope |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| HY8fxO-8hvNqB-43UV4q-1AZ0vu | webdav              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
```

For added security, we recommend setting an expiration date for the app passwords and access tokens you generate. Common scopes for use with app passwords are either "\*" for *Full Access* or "webdav" for [WebDAV-compatible](../sync/webdav.md) [file synchronization apps](../sync/mobile-devices.md).

!!! note ""
    [App passwords](../settings/account.md#apps-and-devices) may be used as access tokens in the *Bearer Authorization* header without first creating a session access token, and to obtain short-lived session access tokens through the `POST /api/v1/session` endpoint.

### Command Options

The following flags can be used with the `photoprism auth add` command (if you omit *name* or *scope*, you will be asked to enter them interactively):

| Command Flag                      | Description                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--name CLIENT, -n CLIENT`        | CLIENT name to help identify the application                                                                 |
| `--scope SCOPES, -s SCOPES`       | authorization SCOPES e.g. "metrics" or "photos albums" (`"*"` to allow all)                                  |
| `--expires LIFETIME, -e LIFETIME` | authentication LIFETIME in seconds, after which access expires (-1 to disable the limit) (default: 31536000) |

### Authorization Scopes

One or more of these scopes can be specified to limit the access to certain API endpoints:

*files, folders, shares, photos, videos, favorites, albums, moments, calendar, people, places, labels, config, settings, services, users, sessions, logs, webdav, metrics*

!!! note ""
    Clients authenticated with app passwords are unable to change the account password or manage user accounts, even if you specify all scopes or use the wildcard `"*"` to allow all.

## Access Tokens

If you do not specify a username as argument for the `photoprism auth add` command, a client access token will be generated (the same flags and scopes as above can be used to limit token authorization and lifetime):

```
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Access Token                                     | Authorization Scope |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 7dbfa37b5a3db2a9e9dd186479018bfe2e3ce5a71fc2f955 | files folders       |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
```

Generating access tokens is a good choice for developers and other advanced users to connect scripts and external services to the PhotoPrism API, e.g. services that collect metrics or start indexing at regular intervals.

Please note, however, that client access tokens cannot be used to synchronize files via WebDAV, even if the token authorization scope is set to "webdav" or "\*", as this requires a registered user account. Access tokens can also not be used as a direct password replacement for apps, since clients are not allowed to use the `POST /api/v1/session` endpoint, which is required for logging in through the user interface.

## Client Credentials

If clients support authentication via [OAuth2 Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/), you can use the following terminal commands to generate a `client_id` and `client_secret` for them, list registered clients, and delete client credentials that are no longer used:

| CLI Command                            | Description                                |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `photoprism clients ls [search]`       | Lists registered client applications       |
| `photoprism clients add [username]`    | Registers a new client application         |
| `photoprism clients show [identifier]` | Shows client configuration details         |
| `photoprism clients mod [identifier]`  | Updates client application settings        |
| `photoprism clients rm [identifier]`   | Deletes the specified client application   |
| `photoprism clients reset --yes`       | Removes all registered client applications |

For example, running the following [in a terminal](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) will generate credentials for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#oauth2), with access limited to the *metrics* endpoint:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism clients add -n Prometheus -s metrics
```

You will then be shown the generated `client_id` and `client_secret` so you can copy them and keep them in a safe place:

```
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Client ID        | Client Secret                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| csce0w2joodmirvi | 5VKkBeZLDvojjpE9XzCMXShnrxmxHWvN |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
```

!!! note ""
    [OAuth2 Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) cannot be directly used for synchronizing files via WebDAV, as a [password replacement for apps](../settings/account.md#apps-and-devices), or for logging in to the web interface.

### Command Options

The following parameters can be used with the `photoprism clients add` command, e.g. to limit the number of access tokens the client can request:

| Command Flag                      | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--name CLIENT, -n CLIENT`        | CLIENT name to help identify the application                                                        |
| `--role ROLE, -r ROLE`            | client authorization ROLE (default: "client")                                                       |
| `--scope SCOPES, -s SCOPES`       | client authorization SCOPES e.g. "metrics" or "photos albums" (`"*"` to allow all)                  |
| `--expires LIFETIME, -e LIFETIME` | access token LIFETIME in seconds, after which a new token must be requested (default: 86400)        |
| `--tokens NUMBER, -t NUMBER`      | maximum NUMBER of access tokens that the client can request (-1 to disable the limit) (default: 10) |

If you omit the *name* or *scope* parameter, you will be asked to enter them interactively. One or more of these scopes can be specified to limit the access to certain API endpoints:

*files, folders, shares, photos, videos, favorites, albums, moments, calendar, people, places, labels, config, settings, services, users, sessions, logs, webdav, metrics*

!!! note ""
    When requesting access tokens, clients can further restrict the scope of the tokens by passing the scope parameter to the `POST /api/v1/oauth/token` endpoint.
