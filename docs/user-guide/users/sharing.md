# Sharing Albums with Guests

Users with the [admin](roles.md#admin) or [user role](roles.md#user) can [create secret links](../share/index.md) to give other [user accounts](index.md) shared access to selected [Albums](../organize/albums.md), [Moments](../organize/moments.md), [Months](../organize/calendar.md), [States](../search/index.md#states), and [Folders](../organize/folders.md). This works in the same way as [sharing with](../share/index.md) [visitors](roles.md#visitor) who do not have an account.

When authenticated users with [limited privileges](roles.md), such as [guests](roles.md#guest), open a share link, they gain permanent read-only access to the shared items until the link is removed or expires.

!!! tldr ""
    In a future release, you will be able to share content with local users directly from the web interface without having to [create links](../share/index.md) first.
