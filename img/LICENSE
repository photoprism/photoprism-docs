provided for download — such as icons, fonts, illustrations, graphics,
wallpapers, videos, sounds, models, and sample files („Digital Assets“) —
as part of the Software distributed by us, unless otherwise noted.

  (b) Because some Digital Assets are licensed to us solely for direct

illustrations, graphics, and videos — embedded in the documentation if they
are licensed to us solely for direct distribution. When in doubt, please ask
before distributing or using them for other works.

  WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOFTWARE AND

SEVERABILITY

  (a) If the Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability set forth above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, the reviewing
courts shall apply the local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of any civil liability in connection with our software and services,
unless a written warranty or assumption of liability has been granted for a fee.

  (b) In the event that any provision set forth above is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be
impaired, affected or invalidated in any way.

  (c) It is hereby agreed and declared that it is the intention of the parties to
enforce the remaining provisions without the inclusion of those provisions that
may subsequently be declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.
